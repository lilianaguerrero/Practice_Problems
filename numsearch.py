# Consider the problem of counting occurrences of a given value x within a sorted array a.
# For example, if x = 5 and a = [1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9], then the count is 2. 

# # 1. Write a function that solves this problem by performing a linear scan. 
# 2. Next, write a function that solves this problem by performing two binary searches. 
# 3. Finally, benchmark your two functions for random sorted arrays of size 10, 100, â€¦, up to 10,000,000. How does performance compare between the two functions?
